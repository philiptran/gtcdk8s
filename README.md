# Kubernetes Workshop at GovTech Con 2018
This repository contains courseware for the Kubernetes Workshop done at GovTech Con 2018 in Singapore.

## Pre-Requisites
This is a technical workshop and is designed for engineers with knowledge/experience in system administration.

## Some Jargon
Throughout this course, Kubernetes will also be known as k8s. The term, k8s, comes about from kubernetes being too long and the `'k'` and `'s'` having 8 characters between them.

## Pre-Course Software
> Install these before you get to the workshop!

It is highly recommended that the command `minikube start` works on your machine before the workshop so that we can move along faster.
